I'm a software engineer with a lot of background in C#, C++ and Python. 
I've worked as a developer for a start-up logistics SaaS company. Furthermore, I am currently working as the main engineer in a consultancy company.
Due to my positions in the above mentioned companies, I've learned how to talk with company owners, how to set the right market value & deliver.

Currently trying to break into the world of micro-saas
