### Hi there, I'm Ivan! <br />
I am a software engineering student, currently interning at Genzai as an R&D developer. <br />

Currently working on: <br />
> Skelly2D - A custom built engine using the Monogame framework as a render engine <br />
> Towerite - A 2D platformer, built using unity <br />
> Rentswipe - A webscraper service, built to help people find accomodation in the Netherlands. <br />

Currently learning more about C++ <br />

Thank you for your time! :) <br />
