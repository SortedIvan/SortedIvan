I'm a software engineer with a lot of background in C#, C++ and Python. 
For the last two years, I have been working mainly on graphics programming and simulations, networking and projects involving advanced data structures. 
I have worked as an engineer at two start-up companies, as well as the largest tech company in the Netherlands - ASML.
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and plan to be getting a Masters in Computer Science, starting September of 2024.
