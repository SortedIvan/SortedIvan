I'm a software engineer with a lot of background in C#, C++ and Python. 
For the last two years, I have been working mainly on lower level topics, such as graphics programming, networking and algorithms. 
I have experience in a variety of companies, including start-ups, consultancy companies, as well as established corporations.
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and plan to be getting a Masters in Computer Science, starting this September.
